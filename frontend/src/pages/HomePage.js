    <h1>Hello, welcome to Magical Lines!</h1>
    <p>
     This site was created to help people learn about application development.
     While this blog has many posts detailing application development and its components, itâ€™s not designed to be a step-by-step tutorial.

     I designed the blog as a teaching tool first and foremost, but it is designed to be simple, clean, and responsive.
     I used MERN stack as my starting points and narrowed them down to what I considered to be the essentials.
     The menu is manually generated but is responsive and built on pure CSS. The HTML focuses on semantics and is built with accessibility in mind.
     The CSS is not based on any framework, and only contains what the blog needs, there are no layout grids or extra UI classes.
